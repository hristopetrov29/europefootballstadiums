            <h2> Mestalla Stadium </h2>
            <p>
               Mestalla Stadium is located in the downtown of the city of Valencia and is home to one of the biggest clubs in Spanish football Valencia C.F. It was initially opened in 1923 and has been renovated a number of times and is even currently undergoing further renovations. It has the capacity of little over 48 000 seats and a metro station located very close to it. It is famous for its steep North stand, which was built like that in accordance with the Spanish architecture at the time. Generally, the whole stadium seems extremely high when it is looked at from the outside. It is also painted in black, as Valencia C.F. are also known as “the bats” and the team color is orange, black and white. It is a must see venue if one visits Valencia. <br />
